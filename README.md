SocialScrapper
==============

A scrapper for social network sites.

This project allows users to specify a search query which will then be checked against various different social media
sources. The sources are extensible but currently it looks through Google blogsearch, tumblr and twitter. 

The project also allows users to get a detailed overview of the searches they have done and breakdown the results 
that are returned.

It is designed to run on amazon AWS EC2 servers with a database hosted on Amazon AWS RDS servers, but can be extended
to run on any server.

It uses underlying python frameworks including:
CherryPy
Requests
SqlAlchemy
Jinja2
parsedatetime
requests_oauthlib


More to come soon...
